                Using this option will generally make the audiobook load
                faster, and will make streaming the file over the internet
                faster.

                This is an extra operation performed after the m4b file
                has been created, and the speed of it can vary greatly
                depending on how fast Libation can read and write from the
                book storage location.

                Most "stereo" audiobooks just duplicate the same audio

                encode the audio as an MP3 using the settings below.

                Enabling this option will remove the credits chapter
                markers and shift the adjacent chapter markers to
