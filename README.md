<a name="theBad"/>

### The bad

* Large file size
* Made by a programmer, not a designer so the goals are function rather than beauty. And it shows

### The ugly

* Documentation? Yer lookin' at it
* This is a single-developer personal passion project. Support, response, updates, enhancements, bug fixes etc are as my free time allows
* I have a full-time job, a life, and a finite attention span. Therefore a lot of time can potentially go by with no improvements of any kind

Disclaimer: I've made every good-faith effort to include nothing insecure, malicious, anti-privacy, or destructive. That said: use at your own risk.

I made this for myself and I want to share it with the great programming and audible/audiobook communities which have been so generous with their time and help.
