# Dolby Atmos

Dolby Atmos (Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3)) is a surround sound technology that creates an immersive audio experience by adding height channels to traditional surround sound setups. It's also used in 4D and spatial audio.

## Downloading Dolby Atmos files

Audible uses a different DRM technology on these files called "Widevine." To remove it, enable "Use widevine DRM" in Settings.

## Listening to Dolby Atmos files

### VLC Media Player

If you save your file with Libation and play it in VLC and only get an image and no audio, the problem is most likely with the audio codecs. Specifically, with the xHE-AAC codec, as it is a modern codec and platforms such as Audible are implementing it in their most recent audiobooks, and VLC cannot process it. In these cases, one user recommended the Polport pre-decoder, which does run this more modern codec and will allow you to listen to your audiobook without any problems. There is an installable and portable version of Polport.

### Samsung Music app

To listen with the Samsung Music app, even if your phone does not have Dolby Atmos enabled, the Samsung Music app will read the Dolby Atmos data in the file. The only condition is that the audiobook must be in M4A format, as M4B is not supported.

If you download it in M4B on your PC, simply change the extension to M4A. You will not lose any quality with that change, and you will be able to play it on the Samsung Music app on your cell phone.
