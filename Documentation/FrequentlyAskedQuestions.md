# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Where can I get help for my specific problem?

**A:** [You can open an issue here](https://github.com/rmcrackan/Libation/issues) for bug reports, feature requests, or specialized help.

## Q: What's the difference between 'Classic' and 'Chardonnay'?

**A:** First and most importantly: Classic and Chardonnay have the exact same features.

* **Classic** is Windows only. Its older 'grey boxes' look has a compact design which allows for more information on the screen. Notably, Classic was written using an older, more mature technology which has built-in support for screenreaders.

* **Chardonnay** is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Its modern design has a more open look and feel.

## Q: Now that I've downloaded my books, how can I listen to them?

## I'm having trouble playing my book with 4D, spatial audio, or Dolby Atmos, how can I fix this?

**A:** Disable the 'Use widevine DRM' option in settings and download it again. [See this page for more information about this file format.](DolbyAtmos.md)

## Q: I'm having trouble loggin into my Brazil account.

**A:** For reasons known only to Jeff Bezos and God, amazon and audible brazil handle logins slightly differently. The external browser login option is not possible for Brazil. [See this ticket for more details.](https://github.com/rmcrackan/Libation/issues/1103)

## Q: How do I use Libation with a South Africa account?

**A:** Like many countries, amazon gives South Africa it's own amazon site. [Unlike many other regions](https://www.audible.com/ep/country-selector) there is not South Africa specific audible site. Use `US` for your region -- ie: audible.com.
